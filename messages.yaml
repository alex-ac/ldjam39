      The electric company is situated in a small dilapidated building.
      Usually there are only two people inside: a fat and slow administrator,
      which never gives you what you want until you give him dozen of papers
      saying what you want and proving that he really has to do it for you.
      The second person is an always drunk electrician, which never goes to fix
      something, until you promise him some booze (and it's the only way to make
      him do something).

      Administrator drives a pen over some papers like always.
